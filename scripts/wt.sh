#
#   make wt-new NAME=my-feature       -> create .claude/worktrees/my-feature + provision + open VS Code
#   make wt-headless NAME=my-feature  -> same, WITHOUT VS Code auto-launch; for worktrees driven by
#                                        background agents from an orchestrating Claude session
#   make wt-rm NAME=my-feature        -> remove worktree dir + git branch
#
# Lives in the shared tooling repo and is reached at `.tooling/scripts/wt.sh`,
# so it must never assume where it is: the repo is resolved from the working
# directory (WT_REPO_DIR, else $PWD), never from $BASH_SOURCE — that would
# resolve to the `.tooling` clone, which is a different git repository.
#
# A new branch is cut from the freshly fetched upstream default branch
# (origin/main) rather than from whatever the main checkout happens to be sitting
# on — otherwise a stale main silently hands every new feature branch an old
# base, and the first `/sync-main` turns into a surprise rebase. Each fallback
# (no origin, failed fetch, unresolvable default branch, pre-existing branch)
# prints why it took a local base instead.
#
# Branch resolution order: an existing LOCAL branch is reused as-is; else an
# existing REMOTE branch (origin/<name>) is checked out tracking its remote
# counterpart — so `make wt-new NAME=<teammate-branch>` continues that branch
# instead of silently re-cutting a same-named one from origin/main; else a new
# branch is cut from origin/main. wt-issue.sh resolves <name> from a GitHub
# issue's linked branch / closing PR and delegates here.
#
# Provisioning per worktree: copy the main checkout's .env, then run the repo's
# own `scripts/provision.sh` if it has one — that is the seam where a Python
# repo makes a venv, a Node repo runs `npm ci`, and a static site does nothing.
# Except for headless, .vscode/ auto-launch files are written so opening the
# folder starts a claude session.
#
# Editor CLI comes from $CODE (default: code) — e.g. `CODE=cursor make wt-open NAME=my-feature`.
