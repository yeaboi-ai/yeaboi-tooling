# scripts/wt-issue.sh <issue-number> [open|headless] — worktree from a GitHub issue.
#
# Resolves the branch belonging to an ongoing GitHub issue and delegates to
# scripts/wt.sh, which (since the remote-branch case landed there) checks the
# branch out tracking origin/<branch>. Resolution order:
#
#   1. Branches linked in the issue's Development section (`gh issue develop --list`)
#   2. The head branch of an open same-repo PR that closes the issue (GraphQL
#      closedByPullRequestsReferences — the reliable link, unlike grepping titles)
#
# Exactly one match is required; several are printed for the caller to pick from
# with `make wt-one NAME=<branch>`. No interactive prompts — like wt.sh, this is
# an entry point for unattended fan-out, where a prompt hangs the orchestrating
# agent forever.
#
# Backs `make wt-issue ISSUE=<number> [HEADLESS=1]`.
